# schema_docs
docs for the schema

## What is this for?

This repo exists so that there is *reduced* complexity in publishing documentation for bids schema tools.
We don't wish to attempt to push multiple parts of the bids specification repo to read the docs.

## What do I need to do to make this repo work?

1) Set up an API token with access to this repo, see [creating a fine grain api token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
2) Accept that one shouldn't be making changes to the `schemacode` as that folder is copied over w/ each push to the bids specification
3) Patience and understanding
